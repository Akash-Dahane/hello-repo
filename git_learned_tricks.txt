step 1:
start with any folder in your file system. using cd pathname...
step 2:
edit description file in .git to name the repository
step 3:
create files, folders , project you want.
step 4: {staging}
staging area contains files,folders that are created/edited and are ready to commit
to the repository.
for staging we need to use following commands
git add filename                //adds given file to staging area,filename should be given with proper extension
git status			// to check current status of the file. if the file is successfully added then 
				//the file will be highlighted in green. if unsuccessful then that will be in red.
git rm --cached filename	//if you want to remove any file from staging area then use this command
git add .			// to add all created/edited files at once
git restore filename		// to undo all edits/changes in given file
step 5: {commiting}
git commit -m "message"		//commits all the staged files with your message/reason/purpose/anything you want to inform
step 6:{logs/history}
git log				//displays history of previous commits
git log --oneline		//displays history in short format
step 7:{checkout,revert,reset}
git checkout commit_ID		//goes back to the status of the repository where that(ref to commit ID) was committed.
git checkout master		//comes back to present latest commit status of the repository.
				//NOTE: checkout does not delete the commit.
git revert commit_ID		//undoes the given commit (ref to commit_ID) from the repository.
				//this is safe option as we can revert back to reverted commit if we changed our mind.
git reset commit_ID		//this is like factory reset option. all the commits from the given commit(ref to commit_ID)
				//are permanently deleted/removed and cannot be traced again.
