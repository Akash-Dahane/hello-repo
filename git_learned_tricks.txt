step 1:
start with any folder in your file system. using cd pathname...
step 2:
edit description file in .git to name the repository
step 3:
create files, folders , project you want.
step 4: {staging}
staging area contains files,folders that are created/edited and are ready to commit
to the repository.
for staging we need to use following commands
git add filename                //adds given file to staging area,filename should be given with proper extension
git status			// to check current status of the file. if the file is successfully added then 
				//the file will be highlighted in green. if unsuccessful then that will be in red.
git rm --cached filename	//if you want to remove any file from staging area then use this command
git add .			// to add all created/edited files at once
git restore filename		// to undo all edits/changes in given file
step 5: {commiting}
git commit -m "message"		//commits all the staged files with your message/reason/purpose/anything you want to inform.
